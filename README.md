# CSE-455-Final-Project
# What are we trying to solve?
We are trying to solve the I Was Busy Thinkin' 'Bout Birds Kaggle Competition. We are trying to achieve a high classification accuracy in classifying different bird species.

Our Overall Rank: 8
# Our Strategy

# Dataset
We got our dataset from the data provided by the Kaggle Competition. This included the test/train images and the text file containing the names of the birds. There are 10,000 images in the test directory and there are approximately 38,000 images in the train directory. The text file contains 555 different bird species names.
# Techniques Used
We used big brain 
# Graphs
None
# Inspiration from Previous Work
We drew inspiration from the Transfer Learning to Pytorch Tutorials provided on the course website to get a better understanding of working with PyTorch in Google Colab. For example, after reading about how the dataset definition worked, we decided to do something similar in the process of connecting our dataset to PyTorch. Our train was essentially the same as any train method, consisting of getting a batch, running the model forward, calculating loss, running the model backward, and finally updating.
